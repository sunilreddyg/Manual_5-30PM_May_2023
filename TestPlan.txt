TestPlan:-->
	=> Test lead design TestPlan by follow test strategy document
	=> It work like guideline document to testing team
	=> Testing team can understand below things from test plan

		Who to test ?     
		When to test ?
		Where to test ?
		what to test ?	

	What are the test plan items ?

	1. TestPlan ID
		Unique Reference number for TestPlan ID.		
		
	2. Project Overview:-->
		Importance of project and quick overview of project.
		
	
	3. Test items: 
		The names of all Testings need to perform on current build
		
		Example:-->
		=> [System Testing, API testing, DB-Testing ---etc]
	

	4.Scope :-->Feature to be tested: 
	The names of requirements or functionality to be test.
	
	Example:-->
	=> Admin Module [Creation, Updation, Delection]


	5.OutScope:--> Feature not to be tested: 
	
	=> The names of tested requirements
	=> The names of requirements part of other team members
	=> The names of testings optional under current release
	[Performance Testing, UnitTesting, Integation Testing  --etc]



  	6.Candidates list:-->
		The names of the users who is responsible to perform testing
		=> The names of the users and their roles  and 					responsibilities.


 	7. Test environment: 
		Required H/w and S/w to use in testing.  
	[Browser Name &  Browser version  &  Operating system]
	[Testenvironment will be setup before start system testing]

	8.Entry criteria: 
		[To start test execution]
 	Test cases prepared and reviewed after training sessions.
	Real test data received from client
	Test environment established by H/w team (computers S/w & H/w).
 	Received s/w build from developers.

	9.Suspension criteria: 
	[To interrupt test execution]
	Test environment Problems (H/w problem)
	Software is not working.
	More defects are in pending by developers.

	10.Resumption criteria:-->
	[When to resume suspended execution]
	After Environment Problemes fixed
	Previously reported defects has been fixed
	
	11.Exit criteria: 
	(To stop test execution)
	All requirement in s/w are tested
	Test duration exceeded
	95% testcase passed
 	All major defects should be re-solved
	[Take screenshot of each test pass/fail]

	12.Test deliverables: 
	The list of testing documents to be prepared by 
	test engineer for future reference 
	[Test scenarios, test cases, test logs, defect reports....]
	[Daily Status Reports, Weekly Status Reports, MOM reports]


	13.Resource Training: 
	The names of selected test engineers for the 
	corresponding project testing and required no. 
	Of training sessions for them to understand 
	customers requirements.


	14. Approach:-->
		Overall approach testing team need to follow

		=> Understand Client Requirements and attend KT session
		=> Identify Test scenarios 
		=> Write testcases in TestRail Management tool
		=> Run Testcase using TestRail Management tool
		=> Report a defect using Jira tool and track defects
		=> Prepare execution status report in daily basis
		=> Every day take testcase backup to excel or google sheets


	15.Risks & Assumptions:

	assumptions: The previously analyzed list of risks 
	and solutions to overcome.
	
	What if time is exceeded?
	Perform Informal testings [Adhoc Testing]

	What if client not specified requirement?
	Perform exploraroty testing

	 No, [It is a test lead job]
	 But i know what testplan contains..


	Que:--> Do you involve in test plan?
	Yes, I followed Testplan to Condcut Software Testing


	Que:--> What test plan contains

		InScope   [Features to be tested]
		OutScope  [Features already tested or Not part of your role]
		Team MileStones
		Build Schedules and DaytoDay schedules
		Test delivarables
